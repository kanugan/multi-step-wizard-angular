# MultiStepWizardAngular

✅1. A multi-step registration wizard (using reactive forms and dynamic form fields in angular).
✅2. One of the fields should have autocomplete

(TODO)

3.  Users should be able to go and back forth between each step, through the browser back and forward buttons. Also, add previous and next buttons to do the same.

✅4. When the user goes back, all the previously entered fields, should retain the values, in them.

5.  (Optional) If you can add test specs, that would be great !
